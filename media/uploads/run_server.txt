You actually made everything worst.
I only spoke about the links below and you went ahead to clear everything including the easy navigating ones. Come on. Why dont you listen.
Now i cant go back to dashboard or move about the page like before. Why making things hard for me. We were on a right path now look, you messed up everything. Goshhh my head even aches. Just simple instructions. now i cant go back, damnnn

I would want us to have a page that will have both login and register link in it. This page will be the mother for the rest of the pages, i mean we should have a page where you will have to open first, before you can access or see either the login page or register page. This page will have both link in the which the user can click on any of them. We will have the School logo as the back ground there. So we will put the links maybe in the middle of the page or what do you suggest. We will have a "Welcome to Yussif University" as the header then followed with the links to login and registration which will be seperated. We will have to structure it in a way we will have "About", "Contacts", "Socials" those things that make up a homepage. This page we are talking about, when a user log outs, he or she can go back to the homepage. What do you think, i believe we are building a solid web page altogether.




1. Admin Dashboard Enhancement
Allow admin users to view:

A full list of all uploaded files (not just their own).

Which student uploaded what.

Option to download any file directly.

We already added basic visibility and download, but we can now build a more polished admin-only dashboard at a special URL like /admin-files/.

2. File Categories or Course Tags
Allow users to select a category (e.g., Assignment, Notes, Past Questions) or Course Name when uploading a file.

This helps in organizing and filtering files.

Adds a dropdown in upload form.

3. Search & Filter Functionality
On the file_list and admin dashboard:

Search files by title.

Filter by date, course/category, or student name (admin only).

4. Profile Page for Students
Show basic info:

Username

Full name

Email

Total files uploaded

Date joined

5. Security & Access Control
Add limit to number of uploads per user (optional).

Prevent same file name conflict.

Add logging for admin (who downloaded what, when).

6. Email Notification on File Upload (optional)
Send a short email to the student after successful upload:

"‚úÖ Your file titled Assignment 1 was uploaded successfully."






Let me know once the system is running so we can proceed to implement file categories next.

With the logout, can we also put an option if they truly want to logout. Example is if the person mistakenly press logout, there should be an option for the person to choose whether to continue with the logout or no. What do you think?



Add password strength indicator

Allow password reset via email

Improve visual design further

Deploy the system online (e.g., Render, PythonAnywhere)

Want to style the login page better?

Want to add a delete file button beside each uploaded file?

Want users to rename files after uploading?

Want to let users edit their profile?
